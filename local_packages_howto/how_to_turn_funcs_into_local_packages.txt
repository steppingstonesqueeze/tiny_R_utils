Put all functions / function code in R/ under your main desired directory, say pds/

In pds/ -- include a DESCRIPTION file and a NAMESPACE file (both attached in this directory)

Say path to pds is : /path/to/pds
Then in Rstudio : devtools::install("/path/to/pds")

and now you can simply use library(pds)
